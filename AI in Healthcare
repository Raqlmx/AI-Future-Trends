# AI in Healthcare

AI is transforming healthcare from diagnostics to treatment planning, patient care, and research.

## Key Trends
**Diagnostics & Imaging**
- AI analyzes scans (X-rays, MRIs, CTs) faster and sometimes more accurately than humans.
- Reduces errors and assists radiologists.

**Predictive Analytics**
- AI predicts disease risks using patient data, genetics, and lifestyle patterns.
- Enables early intervention for diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

**Drug Discovery**
- AI simulates molecular interactions to accelerate drug research.
- Reduces costs and shortens the timeline for new medications.

**Virtual Health Assistants**
- AI chatbots triage patients, schedule appointments, and provide care instructions.
- Improves patient access and reduces staff workload.

## Examples
- DeepMind's AlphaFold predicts protein structures, helping research in disease treatment.
- AI-powered apps assist doctors in detecting early-stage cancer from imaging scans.

## Future Potential
- Autonomous surgical robots guided by AI.
- Personalized treatment plans generated dynamically using AI.
- Integration with wearable devices for real-time monitoring and prediction.
